<h2>Basement</h2>
<p>A basement or cellar is one or more floors of a building that are completely or partly below the ground floor.
It generally is used as a utility space for a building, where such items as the furnace, water heater, breaker panel or fuse box, 
car park, and air-conditioning system are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical system and cable television distribution point. 
In cities with high property prices, such as London, basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space.</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>It involves the choice of technology, the definition of work tasks, the estimation of the required resources and durations for individual tasks, 
and the identification of any interactions among the different work tasks. 
A good construction plan is the basis for developing the budget and the schedule for work.</p>

<h2>Survey</h2>
<p>A building survey is an expert inspection of a property's condition. It identifies any problems with the building to a prospective buyer.
 The inspection is completed by a surveyor who visits the property and prepares a report outlining any problems.</p>
